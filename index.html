                  Earlier telescopes were consisted of glass lenses mounted in a
                  tube, such as Galileo used. Newton discovered when light
                  passed through the lens there were different colors that
                  refracted different amounts.

                  Newton made his first real contribution by advancing the
                  binomial thereom, which he included fraction and negative
                  exponets.
